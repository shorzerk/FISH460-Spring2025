# The Ecophysiological Effects of Water Temperature and Ibuprofen on Hemigrapsus oregonensis

Pharmaceutical contaminants are an emerging concern in marine ecosystems, particularly in nearshore environments where runoff from wastewater treatment plants introduces compounds like ibuprofen. Marine organisms are experiencing rising water temperatures due to climate change. Our experiment seeked to determine the impact on physiology that ibuprofen and increased temperature had. Hemigrapsus oregonensis is a good model species for examining how these environmental changes may affect marine invertebrate health and broader ecosystem function.

The objective of this project was to investigate how exposure to ibuprofen and elevated water temperature—individually and in combination—affects physiological stress responses in H. oregonensis. We specifically tested the hypotheses that (1) increasing ibuprofen concentrations would elevate physiological stress, as indicated by increased oxygen consumption and depleted glucose levels; (2) elevated temperatures would independently increase physiological stress; and (3) combined exposure to both stressors would produce additive or synergistic stress responses.

To test these hypotheses, we conducted a two-week controlled laboratory experiment using 18 H. oregonensis crabs. Crabs were assigned to one of six treatments: ambient temperature (13°C) or elevated temperature (27°C), crossed with three ibuprofen exposure levels—no ibuprofen, an environmentally relevant dose (6.25 µg/L), and a high dose (31.25 µg/L). Oxygen consumption (via a resazurin-based assay) was measured weekly as an indicator of metabolic rate. At the end of the experiment, hemolymph glucose levels were measured as a proxy for energy mobilization under stress.

Our results showed that elevated temperature initially increased metabolic rates in week one, but oxygen consumption decreased by week two under high-temperature conditions, likely due to metabolic suppression from prolonged stress. Crabs exposed to ibuprofen generally exhibited lower glucose levels, particularly at ambient temperatures, indicating depletion of energy reserves or slowed metabolism due to the colder water. Combined effects suggested interactions rather than additive effects, with some ibuprofen treatments showing suppressed oxygen consumption at high temperatures.

To summarize, Rising temperatures and pharmaceutical pollution can significantly alter the physiological state of H. oregonensis, affecting their survival. Considering multiple stressors when assessing anthropogenic impacts on marine organisms is importoant and doing so will provide a foundation for future studies on chronic exposure and broader ecological consequences.
